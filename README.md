**Bankist Website Overview**

Bankist is a sleek, modern web application designed to simulate an online banking experience. It was built using core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website offers a clean, user-friendly interface for managing bank accounts, tracking transactions, and handling other basic banking operations.

**HTML** provides the structure for the site, organizing the content into headings, sections, forms, and tables. **CSS** is used to style the layout, ensuring responsiveness across different devices, and enhancing the visual appeal through color schemes, fonts, and animations. **JavaScript** brings the website to life by enabling dynamic features, such as user interactions, form validation, balance calculations, and the ability to log in or log out, giving it a more interactive, app-like experience.

This project serves as an excellent example of how front-end web development technologies can be combined to build interactive, functional websites.
